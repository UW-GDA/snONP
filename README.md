Backcountry drinking water monitoring for Olympic National Park

Project Title: snONP

Team Members: Olivia Carroll, Owen Nevaril

Project Summary: We will be investigating changes in snow cover in proximity to backcountry trails in Olympic National Park during the summer season, as snow can provide a vital drinking water resource when streamflows are minimal. We will be looking at how the snow cover patterns change over time and what the implications are for backcountry recreation in areas with water scarcity.

Objective: Determine availability of snow as a drinking water resource for backcountry recreators in Olympic National Park.

Datasets: ArcGIS trail maps will indicate key areas for backcountry recreation and we will look at snow data in close proximity to these trails. We will use reflectance data from SENTINEL-2 to determine snow cover. We may use LANDSAT-8 to determine snow extent using NDSI.

Tools/Packages used: Geopands, rasterio, rioxarray, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, ...

Planned approach: 

Expected outcomes: There will be less drinking water resources available during summer months and over years with drought conditions. ???
